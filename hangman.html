            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p> The first pass of this site was done with bootstrap and very little style. I decided to tear that out and
                restyle the page with simple CSS. I have decided to make use of GRID to help handle responsive layouts.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Hangman was one of the early apps I wrote during bootcamp. I revisited the script and page to see how I'd
                do it differently after the course concluded. My first instinct was to load it up with ES6 or switch up entire
                and make use of classes but decided to make a run at it again in as much vanilla JS as I could recall.
